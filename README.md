# Web App From Scratch

I think it would be nice to have an overview of how to get from zero to a working web application via all the popular frameworks like Django, Flask, Laravel, Symfony ...

The idea here is to have a self explanatory shell script for each framework, which turns a fresh Debian installation into a running web application with routing, templates and user accounts.

The reason for the shell script format is that often when I read documentations or tutorials about a technology, I wish it was just a list of commands and not a textual description which tells you which programs to open, which files to edit, where to save them etc.
